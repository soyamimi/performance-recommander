# Utils

The `utils` module contains **helper functions** that are used **transversely** across the project.  
All generic utility functions are located in `helpers.py`.

---

## Purpose

- Provide **reusable utility functions** for multiple modules  
- Keep common operations **centralised**  
- Avoid code duplication across `data_collecting/`, `preprocessing/`, or `models/`.
